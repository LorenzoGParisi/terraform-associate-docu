# TERRAFORM PROVIDERS

When using multiple configurations of a provider (or non-preferred local provider names), you must use the provider meta-argument to manually choose an alternate provider configuration

**Warning**
- Terraform usually automatically determines which provider to use based on a resource type's name.
